Loading data
Creating data loaders
Your dataset doesn't support the fast path for computing the aspect ratios, so will iterate over the full dataset and load every image instead. This might take some time...
Using [0, 0.5, 0.6299605249474366, 0.7937005259840997, 1.0, 1.2599210498948732, 1.5874010519681994, 2.0, inf] as bins for aspect ratio quantization
Count of instances per bin: [12000]
